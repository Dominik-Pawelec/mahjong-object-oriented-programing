# MAHJONG: project for course "Object Oriented Programing"

## How to play:
    Players one by one are drawing tiles and then are discarding them.
    You discard a tile from your hand by clicking it with LMB.
    The goal is to complete a hand with shape of 3 blocks of 3 and a pair.
    "block" might be a sequence of numbered tiles (eg. 1 2 3 of circles) or triplet of the same tile.

    During the game you can "call" tiles discarded by other players to complete a block. 
    If that's possible, pop-up will appear giving you choice to make: make a call, or skip and continue normaly.

    After the game finishes (consisting of around 4 rounds), nr of wins will appear for each player.
